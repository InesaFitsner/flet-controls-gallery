description = """A control that completes drag operation when a Draggable widget is dropped.

When a draggable is dragged on top of a drag target, the drag target is asked whether it will accept the data the draggable is carrying. The drag target will accept incoming drag if it belongs to the same `group` as draggable. If the user does drop the draggable on top of the drag target (and the drag target has indicated that it will accept the draggable's data), then the drag target is asked to accept the draggable's data."""
